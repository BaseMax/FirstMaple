## Maple Language for Beginners

[Maple](http://www.maplesoft.com/products/maple/) is a high-level language and interactive environment for numerical computation, visualization, and programming. Using Maple, you can analyze data, develop algorithms, and create models and applications. The language, tools, and built-in math functions enable you to explore multiple approaches and reach a solution faster than with spreadsheets or traditional programming languages, such as C/C++ or Java.

# Maple

Maple is proprietary software produced by Maplesoft and requires a license to obtain, install, and activate. Arch is not officially supported, but the installer provided by Maplesoft may work in some cases.
